<p style = "color:orange;text-align:justify;">Every successful banker has to perform manageraial responsibilities along with technical banking activities. Although a bank is a financial institution like other businesses, its main objective is to maximize its wealth by
earning profit. Bank business is different from other types of businesses. Other businesses can transfer/shift their goods or services from factory to office or other far places even can export to <span style="background-color:blue;color:white;">foreign countries</span>. But
banks can transfer funds or extend services only after fulfilling the demand for a <span style="background-color:blue;clor:white;">loan </span>of the area where the office or branch of that bank is situated. Efficient management can offer high-quality service, and efficient management can be ensured by efficient organization management. so professional management is impossible without crystallizing the authority & responsibility of all the personal employed in a bank.
